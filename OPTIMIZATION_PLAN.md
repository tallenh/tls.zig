# TLS.zig Optimization Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the optimization strategy for the TLS.zig implementation, focusing on performance improvements while maintaining security and correctness.

## Completed Optimizations

### 1. ✅ Arena Allocator for Handshake Operations
**Status:** Implemented and tested
**Files:** `src/arena_pool.zig`, `src/root.zig`
- Thread-safe pool of arena allocators
- Reduces allocation overhead during handshake
- Automatic memory cleanup with `ScopedArena`
- Pre-allocated memory to minimize fragmentation

### 2. ✅ Reusable Buffer Pool for Encrypt/Decrypt
**Status:** Implemented and integrated
**Files:** `src/buffer_pool.zig`, `src/connection.zig`, `src/root.zig`
- Thread-safe pool of pre-allocated buffers
- Thread-local pool optimization for single-threaded performance
- Integrated into connection.zig for encrypt/decrypt operations
- Added clientWithPools/serverWithPools convenience functions
- Statistics tracking for monitoring usage

### 3. ✅ Signal Pipe Optimization
**Status:** Implemented and tested
**Files:** `src/signal_pipe.zig`, `src/connection.zig`
- Replaced boolean flags with atomic operations
- Implemented edge-triggered signaling support for both Linux (epoll) and macOS/BSD (kqueue)
- Reduced syscall overhead with atomic state tracking
- Automatic detection of pipe2 on Linux
- Atomic deduplication prevents redundant signals
- Platform-specific event flags for optimal integration with epoll/kqueue

### 4. ✅ Compile-time Optional Pipe System
**Status:** Implemented
**Files:** `src/signal_pipe.zig`
- Added OptionalSignalPipe compile-time wrapper
- Zero-cost abstraction when disabled
- Maintains full API compatibility

### 5. ✅ Zero-copy Decryption
**Status:** Implemented and tested
**Files:** `src/zero_copy.zig`, `src/connection.zig`, `src/cipher.zig`
- In-place decryption for AEAD cipher modes (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, AEGIS)
- Automatic detection of buffer overlap and alignment
- Safe fallback to copy-based decryption when needed
- Statistics tracking for monitoring optimization effectiveness
- Integrated into NonBlock connection with opt-in API

## Pending Optimizations

### 6. ✅ SIMD Optimizations (Evaluated)
**Status:** Completed evaluation
**Result:** Zig's standard library already provides optimal hardware-accelerated AES
- Standard library automatically uses AES-NI on x86_64 and ARM Crypto Extensions on AArch64
- No additional SIMD implementation needed
- Avoiding unnecessary complexity and maintenance burden

### 7. ✅ Hot Path Optimization
**Status:** Completed
**Implementation:**
- Added inline to critical functions (encrypt, decrypt, record parsing)
- Implemented fast path for application data (most common case)
- Optimized key update checks with separate inline function
- Reduced function call overhead in hot paths
**Result:**
- Reduced overhead for encrypt/decrypt operations
- Better branch prediction for common cases
- Lower latency for application data processing

### 8. Performance Monitoring
**Priority:** Low
**Goal:** Provide visibility into performance
- Optional performance counters
- Connection statistics
- Buffer pool utilization metrics

## Implementation Strategy

Each optimization will be:
1. Implemented in isolation
2. Tested for correctness
3. Benchmarked for performance impact
4. Integrated with minimal API changes

## Success Metrics

- Reduced memory allocations per connection
- Lower CPU usage for bulk data transfer
- Improved latency for small messages
- Better scalability under high connection count
